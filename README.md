# SWAAC Programming Examples and Learning Samples

The example projects and files in this repository represent my learning about various technologies.

The organization is sort of organic and there are definitely some overlapping technologies.

## Learning by Practice

[Justin Weiss](http://www.justinweiss.com) has offered up the first chapter of his [Practicing Rails](https://www.justinweiss.com/practicing-rails/) for free, and it is a manifesto for how to learn a new technology, not just Rails. I'm so glad he wrote it, as it follows my own and many others' personal learning styles and philosophy as well. The best software craftspeople I know all do something like this:

* read a bit
* try it out
* explore it deeper
* write about it

The old medical school adage for surgeons: "See one, do one, teach one." is so applicable to this, most especially the *last* one.
